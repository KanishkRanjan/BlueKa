/* BLUEKA DESIGN MANIFESTO – Designed by Mateo Cruz
1. Warm & slightly desaturated palette with one bold coral/orange accent
2. Everything feels hand-touched: mixed corner radii (12, 20, 32), uneven padding on purpose
3. Never perfectly centered – always a little breathing room or playful offset
4. Typography: One display font (bold, rounded) + one clean sans. Never more than 3 sizes per screen
5. Micro-interactions everywhere – springs, delays, scale on press
6. Empty states are funny and make you smile
7. Onboarding speaks like a real friend who cares about you
8. Nothing looks like Notion or generic SaaS – this must feel like an indie game from 2019
9. Route Mastery: Every API feels like a conversation — data loads with a wink, errors with a hug
